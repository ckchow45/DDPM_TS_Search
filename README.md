# GenAI_TS_Search
Repository of code for my MSC Applied Bioinformatics research project on developing a generative Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to help transition state searches in discrete path sampling

## All-Atom Coordinate Model
This branch contains the code and training scripts required to train the DDPM and generate a path.

The training script has been separated from the inference script. Make sure to run training_script.py before running inference_script.py
