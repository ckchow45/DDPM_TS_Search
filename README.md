# GenAI_TS_Search
Repository of code for my MSC Applied Bioinformatics research project on making a generative Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for transition state searches in discrete path sampling

## 3 different models were made each kept on separate branches
The All-atom coordinate model is on the All_atom_model branch
The CG model is on the CG_model branch
The dihedral model is on the Dihedral_model branch

Each model will have a script containing all the functions and classes that are called, and a seaparate training script
Please note that all the file paths will need to be updated if you wish to run these as they have been replaced with generic names
