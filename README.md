# GenAI_TS_Search
This branch contains the codebase for training and running the dihedral angleâ€“based DDPM model, which generates coarse-grained RNA backbone structures using predicted dihedrals and fixed internal bond information. These predicted dihedrals are converted into full 3D coordinates through reconstruction with the aforementiond internal coordinate information

## Dependencies
Ensure that you have the following:
- numpy, torch, tqdm, mdtraj, matplotlib (for RMSD/trajectory evaluation)
- The dataset in `.mdcrd` format
- A valid `prmtop` file for topology

## All-atom coordinate Model
This branch contains the code and training scripts required to train the all-atom coordinate DDPM and generate all-atom coordinate discrete paths.

The model operates on Cartesian coordinates. The structures it generates are generally low qualitty and not physically coherent 

The training code and the inference code are kept on the separate scripts `training_script.py` and `inference_script.py`

All the background code on the actual UNet, beta schedule and general model architecture that is imported into the script can be found in `Landscape_DDPM_v2.py`

## Usage
Assuming you have data generated from the `path_generation.py` file and converted them into `.mdcrd` format you can run the `training_script.py` script to train your own model. Then run `inference_script.py` to generate a path

Make sure to update the file paths in the script to match your local directory structure

Optionally, you can use the `RMSD_graph.ipynb` notebook on the main branch to evaluate the generated path with RMSD to start and end

## References
The DDPM model is largely based on the model made by Wang, Heron and Tiwary, with some modifications to allow for conditioning. Their paper can be found here:
